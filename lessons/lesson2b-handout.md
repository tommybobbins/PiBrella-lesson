# Using Scratch to control electronics on the Raspberry Pi

It is possible to connect LEDs, Switches and Buzzers directly to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi can then be programmed to switch these on and off using a language called Scratch. 

## Raspberry Pi controlling breadboard LEDs

1. Attach the following pins from the Raspberry Pi to the LEDs on the breadboard. You may need some help with this.
