# Building simple electronic circuits

An introduction to using electronic components on breadboard with battery packs.


## Learning objectives

- Able to define what an LED is and does.
- Understand how to construct simple circuits using components.
- Be able to troubleshoot simple mistakes in electrical circuits.

# Lesson 1 - Building simple circuits

## Learning outcomes

**All students are able to:**

* Define LED and know where they are used.
* Understand the function of a resistor.
* Understand how a breadboard works.
* Connect a battery pack to a set of traffic lights.

**Most students are able to:**

* Understand that an LED can only be orientated in one direction.
* Understand that the long leg corresponds to the anode (+ve).
* Connect a set of components into a breadboard.
* Troubleshoot problems in electrical circuits.
* Attach one switch to control the traffic lights on/off.

**Some students are able to:**

* Connect push button switches into an electronic circuit to control individual LEDs.
* Extend the circuit adding extra components.


## Lesson summary

*Students will connect up a set of Red, Yellow and Green LEDs to resistors on breadboard.
*When a battery pack is added, students will see the LEDs light up.
*Extend the circuit using switches, to switch on/off LEDs individually.

## Starter

Distribute the student handout. Pupils should be able to work through the material at their own pace.
Handout:
- [Lesson 1 - Handout Using simple electronics.](lesson1-handout.md)


## Main development

Circulate throughout the room assisting where necessary. When the majority of students have got three LEDs working, wrap up and move onto either lesson 2 or lesson 3:

- [Lesson 2 - Connecting simple electronics to the Raspberry Pi](lessons/lesson2-plan.md)
- [Lesson 3 - Working with the PiBrella and the Raspberry Pi](lessons/lesson3-plan.md) 

#Plenary

Holding up the various components, ask the class to define what they are and what function they perform

* Battery Pack
* Breadboard
* LED
* Switch
* Resistor
