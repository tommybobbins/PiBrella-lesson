# Lesson 3 - Using the Raspberry Pi to switch on LEDs

Use the Raspberry Pi and Pibrella to switch the LEDs on/off, using Scratch software.

## Learning objectives

- Able to use Raspberry Pis and Pibrella circuit boards.
- Able to connect & power up the Raspberry Pi.
- Able to use ScratchGPIO to control simple circuits.

## Learning outcomes

**All students are able to:**

* Cable and Power up a Raspberry Pi.
* Start ScratchGPIO.
* Flash all LED.

**Most students are able to:**

* Create Scratch programs to drive GPIO pins.
* Read switch input.
* Drive buzzer.

**Some students are able to:**

* Design complicated Scratch programs to create sequences of LEDs.
* Change buzzer pitch.


## Lesson summary

*Students will connect up the Pibrella board to a Raspberry Pi.
*Extend the circuit using switches, to create a Pedestrian crossing .

## Starter

Distribute the student handout. Pupils should be able to work through the material at their own pace.
Handout:
- [Lesson 3 - Using Scratch GPIO to a Pibrella.](lesson3-handout.md)


## Main development

Circulate throughout the room assisting where necessary.

#Plenary

Check that each group has correctly written a program to light the LEDs on the Pibrella using Scratch in sequence.
