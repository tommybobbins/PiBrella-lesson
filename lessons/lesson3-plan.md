# Lesson 3 - Using the Raspberry Pi to switch on Pibrella LEDs

Use the Raspberry Pi and Pibrella to switch the LEDs on/off, using Scratch software.

## Learning objectives

- Able to use Raspberry Pis and Pibrella circuit boards.
- Able to connect & power up the Raspberry Pi.
- Able to use ScratchGPIO to control simple circuits.

## Learning outcomes

**All students are able to:**

* Cable and Power up a Raspberry Pi.
* Start ScratchGPIO.
* Flash all LED.

**Most students are able to:**

* Create Scratch programs to drive GPIO pins.
* Read switch input.
* Drive buzzer.

**Some students are able to:**

* Design complicated Scratch programs to create sequences of LEDs.
* Change buzzer pitch.


## Lesson summary

*Students will connect up the Pibrella board to a Raspberry Pi.
*Extend the circuit using switches, to create a Pedestrian crossing .

## Starter

* Explain what the Pibrella board is, that it has 3 LEDs and a switch. It also has a Piezo buzzer which allows it to play rudimentary beeps. Ensure that all students know that they must power up the Raspberry Pi and PiBrella using the microUSB (phone charger) socket located on the Pibrella and not on the Raspberry Pi.

* Introduce Scratch, how to drag blocks, the block palette is where blocks are found and that the blocks are colour coded. Create a simple demonstration, showing the Green Flag and Red Button for starting and stopping programs.

* Show how to create a variable in Scratch.

* Explain how to save work in Scratch and the importance of both testing and saving often.

* Distribute the student handout. Pupils should be able to work through the material at their own pace.

## Main development

Circulate throughout the room assisting where necessary.

#Plenary

Check that each group has correctly written a program to light the LEDs on the Pibrella using Scratch in sequence.
