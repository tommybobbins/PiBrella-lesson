   Introduction to the Raspberry Pi

3. Join the blocks together to light the lights in turn. To make a Variable, click on the (Orange) Variables section of the block palette. Make a New Variable. Call it `AddOn`. An Orange `set AddOn to 0` should appear below. Drag this block into the main Scripting area. Make the block say `set AddOn to PiBrella`. Case is important.
