# Using the Raspberry Pi to control circuits

Use the Raspberry Pi to switch the LEDs on/off, using Scratch software.

## Learning objectives

- Able to use jumper jerky to attach Raspberry Pis to circuit boards.
- Able to connect & power up the Raspberry Pi.
- Able to use ScratchGPIO to control simple circuits.

# Lesson 1 - Building simple circuits

## Learning outcomes

**All students are able to:**

* Define LED and know where they are used.
* Understand the function of a resistor.
* Understand how a breadboard works.
* Connect a battery pack to a set of traffic lights.

**Most students are able to:**

* Understand that an LED can only be orientated in one direction.
* Understand that the long leg corresponds to the anode (+ve).
* Connect a set of components into a breadboard.
* Troubleshoot problems in electrical circuits.
* Attach one switch to control the traffic lights on/off.

**Some students are able to:**

* Connect push button switches into an electronic circuit to control individual LEDs.
* Extend the circuit adding extra components.


## Lesson summary

*Students will connect up a set of Red, Yellow and Green LEDs to resistors on breadboard.
*When a battery pack is added, students will see the LEDs light up.
*Extend the circuit using switches, to switch on/off LEDs individually.

## Starter

Show the students the "What is a Raspberry Pi ?" Youtube video. Explain that we will be using the Pi to control our lights.
Distribute the student handout. Pupils should be able to work through the material at their own pace.
Handout:
- [Lesson 2 - Handout Using simple electronics.](lesson2-handout.md)


## Main development

Circulate throughout the room assisting where necessary. When the majority of students have got three LEDs working, wrap up and move onto lesson 3:

- [Lesson 3 - Working with the PiBrella and the Raspberry Pi](lesson3-plan.md) 

#Plenary

Ask the class to define what the various parts of the Raspberry Pi are for.

* Ethernet port
* USB connections
* HDMI port
* GPIO pins
