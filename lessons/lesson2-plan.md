# Using the Raspberry Pi to control circuits

Use the Raspberry Pi to switch the LEDs on/off, using Scratch software.

## Learning objectives

- Able to use jumper jerky to attach Raspberry Pis to circuit boards.
- Able to connect & power up the Raspberry Pi.
- Able to use ScratchGPIO to control simple circuits.

# Lesson 2 - Using the Raspberry Pi to switch on LEDs

## Learning outcomes

**All students are able to:**

* Cable and Power up a Raspberry Pi.
* Start ScratchGPIO.
* Connect an LED to the GPIO pins
* Flash one LED.

**Most students are able to:**

* Connect multiple LEDs to the GPIO pins.
* Understand the role of a resistor in limiting current through the LED.
* Identify potential GPIO pins which can be used.
* Create Scratch programs to drive GPIO pins.
* Attach one switch to the GPIO pins.

**Some students are able to:**

* Connect push button switches which can be read by ScratchGPIO.
* Extend the circuit adding extra components.
* Design complicated Scratch programs to create sequences of LEDs.


## Lesson summary

*Students will connect up a set of Red, Yellow and Green LEDs to GPIO pins on a Raspberry Pi.
*Extend the circuit using switches, to create a Pedestrian crossing .

## Starter

Show the students the "What is a Raspberry Pi ?" Youtube video. Explain that we will be using the Pi to control our lights.
Distribute the student handout. Pupils should be able to work through the material at their own pace.
Handout:
- [Lesson 2a - GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.](lesson2a-handout.md)
- [Lesson 2b - Using Scratch GPIO to control LEDs.](lesson2b-handout.md)


## Main development

Circulate throughout the room assisting where necessary. When the majority of students have got three LEDs working, wrap up and move onto lesson 3:

- [Lesson 3 - Working with the PiBrella and the Raspberry Pi](lesson3-plan.md) 

#Plenary

Ask the class to define what the various parts of the Raspberry Pi are for.

* Ethernet port
* USB connections
* HDMI port
* GPIO pins

Ask the students how the Raspberry Pi pins are numbered.
