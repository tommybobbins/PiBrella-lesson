Introduction to Electronics
===========================

For this part, we will be using Lights, Switches, Wires and Batteries to create a simple set of traffic lights.

First of all we'll look at some components.

This is a Light Emitting Diode (or LED for short). It is similar to a lightbulb in terms of converting electrical current into light. However it has many differences. It emits light when current passes through it in one direction. In the other direction, it blocks the current. It only uses a tiny fraction of the power of a traditional bulb, it does not get so hot and can be switched on and off many more times. For these reasons, LEDs are used in all electronics: phones, tablets, Playstations - everything from TV screens to Blackpool Illuminations.

Sadly it is easy to destroy an LED. To prevent this, we use something called a resistor. A resistor is used to *resist* the flow of current (it is usually a coil of wire which heats up, reducing the overall current flow.)

When electrical engineers destroy components by not using resistors, the components often release a small amount of smoke. Electrical engineers like to call this the magic blue smoke which exists in all electronic equipment to make it work!
