Introduction to Electronics
===========================

For this part, we will be using Lights, Switches, Wires and Batteries to create a simple set of traffic lights.

First of all we'll look at some components.

This is a Light Emitting Diode (or LED for short). Similar to a lightbulb, it convert electrical energy into light. It has many differences from a traditional lamp. It emits light when current passes through it in one direction. In the other direction, it blocks the current. It only uses a tiny fraction of the power of a traditional bulb, it does not get so hot and can be switched on and off many more times. For these reasons, LEDs are used in all electronics: phones, tablets, Playstations - everything from TV screens to Blackpool Illuminations.

As LEDs need to be placed the right way around in a circuit, they need the legs to be easily identified. One leg is longer than the other. This is the positive leg (or Anode). The shorter leg is the Negative leg (or Cathode).


Sadly it is easy to destroy an LED. To prevent this, we use something called a resistor.

## Resistors

A resistor is used to *resist* the flow of current (it is usually a coil of wire which heats up, reducing the overall current flow.)

When electrical engineers destroy components by not using resistors, the components often release a small amount of smoke. Electrical engineers like to call this the magic blue smoke which exists in all electronic equipment to make it work!

To prevent the magic blue smoke escaping from our LEDs, we use resistors. These have coloured bands on the outside of them to help us read how much resistance they provide. Today, we are using Red, Red and Brown bands = 2 2 * 10 = 220 Ohms. (and one Gold band indicates how close they are to this value). 

## Jumperlead
Here is a jumperlead:

Connects different rows of the breadboard together.

## Battery

A batterypack is just a container for batteries. This one contains two AA batteries. Notice that it has a red and black wire. The Red wire is Positive (Anode) and the Black wire is negative (Cathode).
